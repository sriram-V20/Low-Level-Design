# Low-Level Design Preparation Notes

This repository contains all my notes and learnings related to Low-Level Design (LLD). As I progress through my preparation, I'll be documenting various design patterns, principles, and real-world examples to solidify my understanding and share knowledge.

## Contents

- **Design Patterns**: Detailed notes on various design patterns, their use cases, and implementation details.
- **Principles**: Core principles of low-level design, including SOLID principles, DRY, and more.
- **Real-world Examples**: Practical examples of how different designs are implemented in real-world scenarios.
- **Challenges**: Personal challenges and exercises to test my understanding of the concepts.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigation**: Each topic or design pattern will have its own directory. Navigate to the respective directory to find detailed notes and examples.
2. **Feedback**: If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Plans

- Add more design patterns and update existing ones with more examples.
- Include diagrams and flowcharts for better visualization.
- Create a section dedicated to best practices in LLD.
